# Solitaire

Hey Joe and Vitali! Lets make Solitaire!

We should be using git to save progress so we can each work on a part, and then have it available for others to use. Git isn't too hard, but is really confusing at first.

## Git

So basically, your code is stored in a Repository, and that repository is stored on github. Your repository has all your code and files and stuff. If you can, download IntelliJ IDEA Community edition, it's wicked good, and free! https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows So once you open up your IDE, go to File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git, and enter in this URL https://github.com/BlastMcGuirk/Solitaire.git Name it whatever (something like... Solitaire?). Once it opens up, you should have all the code. If it doesn't work, text me... :/

Now that you have it open, you can begin to code and whatnot. Once you have coded something and you think it's right, go up to the top bar and click VCS -> Commit. There you select the files that you changed, and checkmark those boxes. Then you type a message in the Commit part, something informative about what you changed, and click commit at the bottom right. The message should be short and concise, so like, if you worked on Card class, write "Added select method to Card". Then select VCS -> Git -> Push.

The code should then (hopefully) be pushed on to the repository back on github, and then anyone can get the code from there. If you wanna get someone else's changes, first commit any work you have done (if you haven't changed anything then don't commit anything), and lcick VCS -> Git -> Pull. This will update your code to look like this repository.
